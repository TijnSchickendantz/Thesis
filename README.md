# Incentivizing green technology diffusion


## Contributor:
* Tijn Schickendantz


## Program Overview
This work aims to model the diffusion of technologies through two jurisdictions. Producers and consumers supply and demand either the old or the new technology.
Based on the agents' own payoff, expected payoffs of groups and social influence, agents can switch their technology preferences.



## Requirements
* Python 3.9+
* math
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* mesa
* scipy stats
* time
* random
* joblib
* warnings

## Running the code

To run the model, one needs to run the abm.py file. At the bottom of this file, printing of output can be (un)hashed 
to print the desired output of the model.
